You will mostly see code in C#, Rust, C++, maybe C! 
In the process of learning and migrating to a system's level programming language!

My main programming language has been C# for most of my professional carreer! I feel most comfortable when developing with it!
Any managed language is fine and i am quite familiar with some frontend and the (jquery, vanilla js, react framework) for frontend! 
You won't find good styling options here :)!
