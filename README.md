You will mostly see code in C#, Rust, C++, maybe C! 
In the process of learning and migrating to a system's level programming language!

My main programming language has been C# for most of my professional carreer! I feel the most comfortable when developing with it!
I feel comfortable with any managed language and i am quite familiar with the react framework for frontend! Please don't ask me to style!
